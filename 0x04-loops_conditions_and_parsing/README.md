# 0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing

*This directory contains various shell scripts that demonstrate the use of loops, conditions, and parsing in Bash scripting.*

## Files:

1. **0-RSA_public_key.pub:** This file contains the RSA public key, which is used for asymmetric encryption and decryption. The contents of this file are typically shared with others to encrypt data that only the corresponding private key can decrypt.

2. **1-for_best_school:** This script showcases the 'for' loop in Bash. It likely performs a specific task repeatedly, iterating over a sequence of elements. The script might demonstrate how 'for' loops are used to automate tasks efficiently.

3. **2-while_best_school:** This script demonstrates the use of a 'while' loop in Bash. It likely repeats a certain task until a specific condition is met, showcasing how 'while' loops are utilized in shell scripting.

4. **3-until_best_school:**  Similar to the previous script, this one also involves a loop but specifically the 'until' loop. It may illustrate how 'until' loops work and when they are useful.

5. **4-if_9_say_hi:** This script probably involves conditional statements ('if' statements) in Bash. Depending on a condition, it might print "Hi" when the number 9 is encountered.

6. **5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance:** This script could be a playful implementation, possibly using conditionals to print messages related to superstitions or luck based on specific numbers.

7. **6-superstitious_numbers:** This script might explore superstitious beliefs related to numbers. It could analyze or generate numbers considered lucky or unlucky in various cultures.

8. **7-clock:** This script could involve displaying the current time or a clock-like visualization using ASCII art or other creative means.

9. **8-for_ls:** This script likely utilizes a 'for' loop to iterate over files in the current directory (or a specified directory) and performs specific actions on each file, such as listing their names or properties.

10. **9-to_file_or_not_to_file:** This script might deal with file operations, possibly prompting the user for input and deciding whether to store the input in a file or display it directly.

11. **10-fizzbuzz:** FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem. This script probably implements the FizzBuzz game, where numbers from 1 to 100 are printed. For multiples of 3, "Fizz" is printed, for multiples of 5, "Buzz" is printed, and for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" is printed.

12. **100-read_and_cut:** This script likely involves reading input from a file or standard input (stdin) and then performing operations such as cutting specific fields or columns from the input data.

13. **101-tell_the_story_of_passwd:** This script may involve parsing the 'passwd' file on a Unix/Linux system. It could extract user account information like usernames, user IDs, home directories, and shell paths.

14. **102-lets_parse_apache_logs:** This script probably deals with parsing Apache web server logs. It may extract valuable information like IP addresses, request methods, response codes, and timestamps from the log files.

15. **103-dig_the-data:** This script might involve data extraction and analysis. It could read data from various sources and perform operations like counting occurrences, filtering, or aggregating the data.
