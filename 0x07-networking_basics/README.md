# Networking Basics

This directory contains the following files, each explaining different aspects of networking basics:

1. **0-OSI_model**: This file explains the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which is a conceptual framework used to understand how different networking protocols interact in network communication.

2. **1-types_of_network**: In this file, you will learn about the different types of computer networks, such as LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), and WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network), along with their characteristics and use cases.

3. **2-MAC_and_IP_address**: Here, you will get insights into MAC (Media Access Control) and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. This file explains the differences between the two and their significance in networking.

4. **3-UDP_and_TCP**: This file delves into UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). It covers their features, advantages, and use cases, helping you understand when to use each protocol.

5. **4-TCP_and_UDP_ports**: In this file, you will learn about TCP and UDP ports. It explains how ports are used to identify specific applications or services on a network and how they play a crucial role in establishing communication.

6. **5-is_the_host_on_the_network**: This file explores various methods to determine if a host is active or reachable on a network, including using tools like `ping` and `traceroute`.
